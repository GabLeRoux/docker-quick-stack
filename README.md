# Web Platform Startup

This repository contains a docker definition and script that will get up and running in the minimal amount of time. It's main features are

- Web infrastructure in a box (NGINX, PHP, MySQL, COUCHDB, ELK)
- A toolchain image that provides tools you will need as a developer
- An always up-to-date version of the database which we can share internally. It aims to make using various docker-compose options simple
